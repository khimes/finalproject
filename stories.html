              <h3>Wendy’s</h3>
              <body>
                My time working as a cashier at Wendy’s gave me arguably the most life experience in my short twenty-two years of life. Working there, I was one of three employees who spoke fluent English. I encountered new cultures, new customers, and a new routine. 
<br>Working in fast food gave me the best outlook on life.
<br>It really showed me how high my work ethic really is. I came in early and left late every day. I really tried hard with this job, because I wanted to do well.<br> I was a senior in high school, and wanted to make money while balancing having a life.
<br>Ultimately, this job taught me to have more respect for myself.
There came the point when all the new employees coming in were making two dollars more than I was, and I had been there for nine months. A tip to employers, value the workers you have or they will find something better.
I was facing disrespect at my job. 
<br>One time a lady threatened to fight me, why? We were understaffed and she had been waiting for five minutes. My manager was nowhere in sight. We had three people working a seven-person job.
<br>It was insane.
<br>This woman slams her hands on the counter and begins to try to jump over it, and I am standing there petrified. This group of people swore at us, and threatened us. I was eighteen years old and did not know what to do.
<br>Thankfully my manager came back on time to deescalate her behavior, but he provided no backup at all whatsoever.
<br>I learned that day, that people are cruel.
I also learned that day that I would never treat someone the way those people treated me and my crew.
<br>I left that job two weeks later and pursued a career in education.
Three years later I am the happiest I have been and fulfilled in my career.
<br>I will never forget how I felt that day, and I would never let someone be treated that way in my presence again.

<h3>Colorguard</h3>
That picture you see on the front page is one of my last performances in the marching band. <br>
We had just swept the competition, and demolished the competition.
<br>That day that picture was taken, we performed in a monsoon of rain.
It was…crazy.
<br>The theme of our show that year was ‘rainforest’, it was our time. We were all soaked and freezing, our equipment also was difficult to maneuver.
<br>While it was not perfect, we put on a performance of a lifetime.
The energy on the field was amazing.
<br>I loved it, truly.
I miss guard, and it really was fundamental for helping me become the person I am today.
<br>That night, all the seniors gathered on the field for the awards ceremony.
<br>Once we were given first place, the euphoria was intense.
We all cried, and hugged each other.
For that was the last time we would all ever be in that moment again.
<br>As I am writing this I am getting emotional thinking about it.
I would give my pinky to experience that day again.
It truly was, remarkable.
<h3>Chess Tournament </h3>
Working with children teaches us a lot about how we grew up, and what mistakes to avoid.
Children are just little people who have really <b>big feelings<b>, and honestly have helped me slow down in life.
    <br>When I began working for a daycare program in my county, I did not expect to bond with these kids as much as I did.
    <br>I was getting paid to be there, but I saw them for more hours in a day than their parents.
    <br>As I bonded with these kids, I would do little activities with them.
    <br>One day, a little girl asked me to place chess.
She became so infatuated with the game, and her new goal in life was to beat me.
<br>I had the idea to start the chess tournament when the game began to gather large traction from the kids.
So one day I hosted an iron man tournament, and the winner of that tournament would face me.
Think of it as a ‘final boss’ type of deal.
<br>So these kids begin the tournament, and one by one they eliminate themselves.
The civil competition was interesting to watch, because kids you would not expect to be competitive suddenly were <i>very</i> competitive.
<br>I pride myself in the way they handled losses though, no fights were to be had!
Anyway, so the tournament finishes up, and it is my turn to play.
<br>We all come to that dilemma in life whether to make them work for it or let them have the win.
In this case, I let the kid win, because at the end of the day I believe hard work is important, but letting them learn confidence is even better.
<br>Memorable quote from the day, “Ms. H, have you ever lost a game of chess in your life?”
Yes, Jimmy. Yes, I have.
