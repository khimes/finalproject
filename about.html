                <p>As a kid I have always wanted to be a story teller, but never found the right creative outlet to do so.
                With this website, I hope to share some funny anectdotes that will entertain you. 
                  <br> You will read of some of my many journey's throughout life, and interesting encounter's.
                  <br> Ultimately I hope anyone who encounters this website gets a good laugh for the day.
                  <br> Enjoy! </p>
