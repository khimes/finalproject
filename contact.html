<br>I am based out of the DM(V)! I have lived in Northern Virginia for fifteen of my twenty-two years.<br>
 My father was in the United States Navy, so we moved frequently when I was young. In my spare time I love to play guitar, play games, and go on walks with my dog. I have worked in the education field since I was nineteen years old. I plan on finishing my degree at George Mason University in December 2022, and pursuing a Masterâ€™s in teaching English as a second language. My passion is with my students, and I love being in a classroom.
